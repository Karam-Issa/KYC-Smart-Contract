# KYC-Smart-Contract
 This repository contains a Solidity smart contract for managing Know Your Customer (KYC) processes in the banking sector. The contract enables secure onboarding of customers, KYC requests, and data updates while maintaining transparency between banks. Ideal for enhancing customer verification procedures.


## Description

This Solidity smart contract facilitates Know Your Customer (KYC) processes for banks on a blockchain network. KYC is a process used by banks and financial institutions to verify customer identities, prevent fraudulent activities, and ensure regulatory compliance.

## Features

- **Admin Account:** The contract includes an admin account for specific administrative actions.
- **Bank Actions:** Participating banks can interact with the contract to perform various actions like adding KYC requests, approving requests, managing customers, and more.
- **KYC Requests:** Banks can add KYC requests, and the admin can approve or decline them.
- **Customer Management:** Banks can add, remove, and modify customer information, stored securely on the blockchain.
- **Event Logging:** The contract emits events to log actions like adding KYC requests, customers, and more.
- **Bank Privileges:** Admin grants banks privileges to add customers, request KYC reports, and view customer data.

## Contract Structure

The contract is structured as follows:

- **Admin Account:** The contract deploys with an admin account.
- **Enums:** Enumerations define values for bank actions and KYC statuses.
- **Events:** Events are emitted to log actions within the contract.
- **Structs:** Define structures for customers, banks, and KYC requests.
- **Mappings:** Associate data like customer information, bank details, and KYC requests.
- **Modifiers:** The onlyAdmin modifier restricts certain functions to the admin.
- **Functions:** Handle actions like adding KYC requests, managing customers, and more.
- **Internal/Private Functions:** Handle various tasks and auditing.
- **Getter Functions:** Fetch information about customers, banks, pending KYC requests, and more.

## Deployment

Deploy the contract on a blockchain network (e.g., Ethereum or Ganache). Initialize with the admin bank. Admin can add other banks and define their privileges. Banks interact using their addresses.

## Usage

1. Deploy the contract on a blockchain network.
2. Admin adds other banks and defines privileges.
3. Banks manage KYC requests, customer data, and more.
4. Admin approves/declines KYC requests.
5. Banks request/view KYC statuses of customers.

## Note

This readme provides an overview; actual interaction requires Ethereum-compatible tools (Solidity, Truffle, Remix, web3.js).

**Disclaimer:** The provided contract is a simplified educational version. Thorough testing, security audits, and compliance reviews are necessary for production use.
